    <h1 class="rainbow">Welcome to my website!</h1>
    <p>Here's a little bio about me, I'm a highly trained jedi and 
      billionaire with super powers that include being able to 
      swallow anything. During the clone wars I defeated countless 
      droids and sith by consuming them, flying around in my tesla x spaceX spaceship, 
      shit was lit. Now I wanna consume somthing more tasty. 
      I dunno how about the whole erc space? Like all of it, 
      I'm gonna be the dominant cryptocurrency, nothing can stop me.
